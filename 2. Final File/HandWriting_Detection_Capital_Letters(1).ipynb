Well in numerator we are finding data wrt single label, and we are adding 1 to make it non zero, but then in denominator we are taking total probability of same data over all label, so each label will have a corresponding 1 added to it, to make the assumpltion hold, and since it is total probability in the denominator therefore all labels will be added, there for 1 will be added as many times as the total number of labels which is nothing but bin_size.\n",

In multiplication even when 0 is encountered a single time it will make the whole term 0 and so we won't get any significant result, but in addition this problem this should have been resolved, as even when even a single one is 0 then also whole term won't be affected. Well, yeah but that leads to another issue, i.e. now log will get input as 0. So a jugaad logic to deal with this is that we add 1 to each probability value, which is not mathematically valid, but it gives us answers with very low accuracy.
